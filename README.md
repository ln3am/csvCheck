A tool that provides a user friendly way to check
CSV files and correct or filter / sort out their unwanted 
column value properties - offers storable checking parameters and a way to expand methods which check and correct the values 

- the needed "csvin" folder which stores data input and outputs is currently not existant 
I'll add ways to use this properly in the future.
